# MeshArrays.jl

`MeshArrays.jl` defines an array type that can contain / organize / distribute collections of inter-connected arrays as done in climate models (depicted below). `MeshArrays.jl`'s data structures can be used to accurately analyze [ocean heat transport](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0333-7), [material displacements](https://juliaclimate.github.io/IndividualDisplacements.jl/dev/), and many other important topics in climate science.
