# MeshArrays.jl documentation

`MeshArrays.jl` primarily defines composite types that embed inter-connected array collections within a `struct` and provides an `exchange` function that effectively transfers data between connected arrays. 

Such computational frameworks are commonly used in Earth System Modeling. `MeshArrays.jl` is inteneded as a simple but flexible solution. It was originally introduced as `gcmfaces.jl` in this [JuliaCon-2018 presentation](https://youtu.be/RDxAy_zSUvg) (see below for **notebooks**). 

_Note:_ 

`MeshArrays.jl` is registered, documented, archived, and routinely tested, but also still regarded as a **preliminary implementation**.

_Contents:_

```

## Install & Test

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MeshArrays")
Pkg.test("MeshArrays")
```
_Note:_ 

`Julia`'s package manager is documented [here within docs.julialang.org](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/Pkg/).

## Use Examples

```
using MeshArrays
GridVariables=GCMGridOnes("cs",6,100)
(Rini,Rend,DXCsm,DYCsm)= MeshArrays.demo2(GridVariables);
```

The above will run an application which integrates lateral diffusion over a simplified global grid generated by `GCMGridOnes`. Alternatively, 

```
git clone https://github.com/gaelforget/GRID_LLC90
GridVariables=GCMGridLoad(GCMGridSpec("LLC90"))
```

would download and use a pre-defined global ocean grid, from the `MITgcm` community, to run the same example with a proper representation of scale factors and continents. 

The [JuliaCon-2018 presentation](https://youtu.be/RDxAy_zSUvg) relied on similar examples available as two `Jupyter notebooks` in [this other repo](https://github.com/gaelforget/JuliaCon2018Notebooks.git). For plotting directions, see the help section (`?MeshArrays.demo2`). Additional demo functions are also provided with the package (e.g., `MeshArrays.demo1`, `MeshArrays.demo3`).

## Main Features

**MeshArrays'** composite types contain array collections. Elemental arrays in a `MeshArray` are typically inter-connected at their edges according to a user-specified global structure. `exchange` methods transfer data between neighboring arrays to extend their computational domains, as often needed to compute e.g. planetary transports in the climate system.
