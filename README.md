# GCMFaces

This repository contains a first implementation of the `GCMFaces.jl` package **which has only been tested in `v0.6` and is not ready for production use.**

### Install the package 

The following should work in `v0.6`:

`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/gaelforget/GCMFaces_jl.git")`

### Jupyter Notebooks

The notebooks used for [JuliaCon-2018](http://juliacon.org/2018/) are: 

`src/demo_type.ipynb` and `src/demo_exch.ipynb`


### Pre-defined grids

Pre-defined grids for use with the notebooks are available [here](http://mit.ecco-group.org/opendap/gforget/grid_examples/contents.html) and can or example be downloaded as follows:

`wget --recursive ftp://mit.ecco-group.org/gforget/grid_examples/GRID_CS32/`
